## Jan 22-23
- This weekend I had some coding assesments and other stuff so I decided to join hackathons alone as I wasn't sure if I'll be able to fully commit to it and didn't wanna burden other team members.
- Worked on [Breathe.ly](https://devpost.com/software/breathe-ly-xrhmz9) and submitted to Hack Cambridge, QWER Hacks and StarHacks II 
- Won MLH: Best use of Google Cloud Prize in StarHacks II and runner up prize in Health & Wellness Track in QWER Hacks
